# Perpetual Adoration Sign-In Sheet Script
This project contains a Google Apps Script used to automate the creation of daily Perpetual Adoration sign-in sheets in Google Sheets using a reusable template.

## What it does
- Duplicates a predefined template multiple times in one sheet
- Inserts spacing between each section for printing
- Automatically sets the correct date on each page

## Why it exists
Manually creating dozens of identical sign-in sheets was time-consuming and prone
to formatting and date errors. This script reduces the task to a single action.

## Tech used
- Google Sheets
- Google Apps Script (JavaScript)
